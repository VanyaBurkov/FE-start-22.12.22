    <h2>
        History.
    </h2>
    <p>  One factor in estimating when water appeared on Earth is that water <strong>is continually being lost
         to space.</strong> <span>H<sub>2</sub>O</span> molecules in the atmosphere are broken up by photolysis,
         and the resulting free hydrogen atoms can sometimes escape Earth's gravitational pull. 
         When the Earth was younger and less massive, water would have been lost to space more easily. 
         Lighter elements like hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually,
         but isotopic ratios of heavier noble gases in the modern atmosphere suggest that even the heavier
         elements in the early atmosphere were subject to significant losses. <b>In particular,</b> xenon is
         useful for calculations of water loss over time. Not only is it a noble gas (and therefore is not removed from
         the atmosphere through chemical reactions with other elements), but comparisons between the abundances of its
         nine stable isotopes in the modern atmosphere reveal that the Earth lost at least one ocean of water early in
         its history, between the Hadean and Archean eras.

        <i>Geological evidence</i> also helps constrain the time frame for liquid water existing on Earth. A 
        sample of pillow basalt (a type of rock formed during an underwater eruption) was recovered from
         the Isua Greenstone Belt and provides evidence that water existed on <em>Earth</em> 3.8 billion years ago.
