        Properties.

    <p>
         Water (chemical formula <span>H<sub>2</sub>O</span>) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless,
         odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent 
         of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms. 
   </p>
    <p> 
        <b><i>Water</i></b> (<span>H<sub>2</sub>O</span>) is a polar inorganic compound. At room temperature 
         it is a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly colorless with a hint of blue. This simplest 
         hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the
         "universal solvent" for its abilityto dissolve many substances. This allows it to be the
         "<strong><em>solvent of life</em></strong>": indeed, 
         water as found in nature almost always includes various dissolved substances, and special steps
         are required to obtain chemically pure water. Water is the only common substance to exist as a solid,
         liquid, and gas in normal terrestrial conditions.
